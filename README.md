# online_shop
Django unfinished online shop project
includes:
- 'product-customer-order' backend logic (models);
- Django admin tools for adding products and their images, setting prices and 'active' status, creating orders (some products are already there, as examples);
- templates: base, main page, catalog, product, cart;
- a little style provided by bootstrap;
- cart does not work as planned, needs fix! (in progress)
